# Namaste React ðŸš€
- React uses Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)
- It is a React core algorithm.
- React is doing efficient DOM manipulation beacuse it has Virtual DOM.

    - Whenever there is a chnage in a state variable, React will findout the difference between virtual dom and it will rerender the dom.
